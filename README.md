# CC_ProgBasic_Exercise_01
This is an exercise task for students to practice on, see the description of the tasks below. Have a good time :)

1; When we press the "btn-add-pressure" button the value "sensor-value" changes, change the code so this value cannot go over 99 and cannot be lower than 1.

2; Implement the function for the "btn-reduce-pressure" button which reduces the "sensor-value" by 15.

3; We want the "sensor-current" to have a different color based on the "sensor-value", change the code so if the value is 
    25 or lower than is has the class "good",
    if it's higher than 25 but not higher than 75 than it's class is "warning",
    if higher than it's class is "danger".

4; Based on the previous values change the text in the "sensor-state" when the value is 
    good to "good",
    if warning then to "warning", 
    and if it's danger then to "danger".

5; Implement a feature where the height of the "sensor-current" changes when the "sensor-value" changes to the exact same value in %.
    For example if the value is 50 than the height of the "sensor-current" is 50%,
    if the value is 70 than the height of the "sensor-current" is 70%.

6; Check the already implemented function which is triggered by pressing the "btn-save" button.
    Explain what happens when does this function run and what happens.

7; Based on the saved values get the average value of the saved values and display it at the header with the id of "average-value".
